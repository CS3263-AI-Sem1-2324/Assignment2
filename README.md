# CS3263 Assignment 2

Hi, welcome to CS3263 assignment 2! You can complete all problems in [the main notebook](./main.ipynb) with detailed instructions.

After you complete your codes, **Please remember to copy your solutions into [the `programming.py` script](./programming.py)** for our evaluation.

The programming part will be auto-graded on [CodePost](https://codepost.io/) platform.
- You should have received an email to create and activate your CodePost account in Assignment 1. 
- You don't need to submit to CodePost, we will import your submissions from Canvas.
- Note the `programming.py` file is designed for auto-grading, so you can't run it normally from your end but don't worry. 
- In the `programming.py` script, **DO NOT** modify any code outside the blocks you're allowed to, **DO NOT** print any other message.
- The solution for test case 0 is provided for you in `data/V_0.py` for your checking. Comment out the solution checking code in the `test()` function if you wish to test other environment scenarios
- You can setup your own test cases in the `minihousev1.py` file and import them into the `test()` function block for your own testing.

Your submission should zipped and named as `netid1-netid2.zip`. The folder structure should be **strictly** formed as follows:

(netid refers to the student number that begins with EXXXXXX)
```
netid1-netid2.zip
|---programming.py
|---main.ipynb
```
